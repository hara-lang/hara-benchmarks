# lisp-hara benchmark

Balanced application-kernel comparison of the Hara Rust runtime tiers against
**SBCL**, **Chez Scheme**, **GNU Guile**, **LuaJIT**, **Babashka**, **Python**,
**C**, and **Java**. The original tiny
microbenchmarks remain in `suites/runtime/`; this corpus exercises mutable
arrays, mutable objects, persistent data, recursion, and mixed control flow.

## Requirements

```shell
brew install sbcl chezscheme guile
```

The extended lanes also use `bb`, `python3`, `cc`, and JDK 21. Java defaults
to Homebrew's `/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21`; override it with
`HARA_BENCH_JAVA_HOME`.

Plus the hara benchmark binaries (built automatically unless `--no-build`):

- `rust/target/release/hara-runtime-benchmark`
- `target/runtime-benchmark/{vm,trace-checked,trace-native}/release/hara-bytecode-benchmark`

## Usage

```shell
python3 -m hara_bench run --suite algorithms --profile smoke
python3 -m hara_bench run --suite algorithms --profile weekly
python3 -m hara_bench run --suite algorithms --profile nightly
python3 -m hara_bench run --suite algorithms --runtime sbcl-prepared --runtime hara-rust-trace-native-prepared

# General-computing acceptance slice: Sieve, Towers, Queens, Heap permutation
python3 suites/language/run.py --profile standard \
  --corpus suites/language/general-workloads.json \
  --runtime sbcl-prepared --runtime chez-prepared --runtime guile-prepared \
  --runtime luajit-prepared --runtime hara-rust-whole-wasm-prepared \
  --output target/general-computing-standard.json
```

Runtime names carry an explicit `-eval` or `-prepared` lane. Compare only
within a lane. Hara's tree evaluator participates in `-eval`; bytecode and
trace tiers participate in both compile/execute and prepared execution.

Results default to `target/lisp-hara-benchmark.{json,md}` (gitignored
scratch — comparison evidence, not regression gating).

## Semantics

Mirrors the luajit-hara suite so numbers are comparable across suites:

- `workloads.json` carries per-language source fields (`hara_source`,
  `scheme_source`, `cl_source`, `bb_source`) plus a shared `expected` checksum.
- `-eval` parses/loads and evaluates source on every measured call.
- `-prepared` reads and compiles/loads once, then invokes repeatedly.
- Mutable table rows use Hara `object`/`array` (through their canonical
  native calls), Scheme/Common Lisp hash tables and vectors, and Lua tables.
  Persistent transformations are named and reported separately.
- Unsupported runtime/workload combinations are retained in the feature
  coverage table with their error; they are never silently substituted.
- Lisp sources are hand-written **untyped** idiomatic equivalents (no
  SBCL type declarations or `optimize` declarations, portable R6RS-ish
  Scheme) — an implementation snapshot, not a source-normalized shootout.
- Scheme runners time with wall clock (Chez `current-time`) / run time
  (Guile `get-internal-run-time`); SBCL uses `get-internal-run-time`
  (CPU time, like the Lua runner's `os.clock`).

## Files

- `workloads.json` — the shared corpus
- `general-workloads.json` — the first general-computing acceptance slice,
  derived from established benchmark families rather than micro-kernels
- `chez_runner.scm`, `guile_runner.scm`, `sbcl_runner.lisp` — per-runtime
  runners implementing the `ID SOURCE_HEX EXPECTED WINDOWS CALLS` contract
- `bb_runner.clj`, `python_runner.py`, `c_runner.py`, `java_runner.py` — the
  additional dynamic and compiled runtime adapters; C and Java expose only a
  prepared lane
- `run.py` — the coordinator (windowed sampling, steady-state median,
  JSON + Markdown output)
